{"src": "The British parliamentary electoral system is unfair and undemocratic .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes , changing it 's policies , until the next general election , at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power , just to gain votes .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "A very important characteristic of the UK constitution , and one which is central to the question of sovereignty , is that it is the Westminster Parliament that is the supreme legal authority in the UK .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "According to the orthodox school which subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey , the Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject it likes to regulate the activities of any person , anywhere , even those of aliens outside British territory .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In theory , then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of Paris .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If our Parliament did so , British courts would be obliged to accept Parliament 's decision and pass judgement accordingly .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Of course , in practise , as the Radical school ( who believe that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme ) point out , in this hypothetical situation , the Parisiens would take no notice whatever of the UK Parliament 's legislation ; and Parliament would in effect be fettered .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Dicey said that as each Parliament is omnipotent , and therefore has the power to make or unmake any law , no Parliament could bind its successors as to the content or manner and form of subsequent legislation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The Radical like to point out that since the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972 , the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The orthodox school retaliate by pointing out that since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 Act thereby putting the UK into the European Communities , a future Parliament could just as easily repeal this Act , and take us out of Europe again .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In this case , Britain would have retained her sovereignty and Parliamentary supremacy .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Of course , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "British courts have avoided a head - on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity so as to give effect to our Community obligations , or by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament or by arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertant and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with community law .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In a recent development , the European Court of Justice rule in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament where the rights of the citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This case for the first time said that it is a principle of UK law as influenced by the European Court that our Parliament is not supreme in every circumstance .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It would seem , therefore , that the advent of a single Europe is indeed meaning a loss of sovereignty for Britain , whatever the orthodox school may think to the contrary .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "I beg to differ ; crime does pay .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Being a criminal has it 's advantages ; you do n't have to worry about being fired , you can make more money in less time , you set up your own hours because you 're your own boss , and you can retire well before the age of 65 .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Let 's take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A criminal will always be employed .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Then if we think about the work day of most working people .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The average worker works 8 hours per day .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They make about $ 7.50 per hour for their labor .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This is $ 300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Tax deductions will run about $ 69.00 per week and deductions for medical / dental insurance will costs them another $ 5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $ 266.00 per week .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $ 300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The criminal is his / her own boss .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "And finally , the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker ; retirement .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they ( the criminal ) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "At $ 300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $ 1,170,000.00 .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If he / she invest half this money and earns interest they could potentially live on the interest income alone .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Comparing both options here , I 'd definitely say that crime does pay .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "In the other hand , it is not very good safety .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Motorcycle is the most dangerous transport in Thailand compares with others .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Even if we have a traffic rule , some riders still keep breaking the rule .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Continue with minibus , there are some rules for this type of transportation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The drivers have to follow the traffic rules .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I found that it is good transportation which cost low prices and travel a long distance .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Therefore people in low to medium class prefer to use this transport .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "People who live around the city are usually makes an appointment in downtown .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Because of a heavy traffic jam in Bangkok so they try to avoid other services .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Then , BTS is the best optional .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is very satisfy by time and convenience .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "People can manage their time easier because BTS is fixed in time .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Therefore this transport is the most predictable .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Thailand is a country that is not strict to the rule .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Personally , I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This is probably for several reasons : First , the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Since it is my socialization that leads me to have a notion of earthtime [ 24 hours = day ] I think Einstien reconstructed part of it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Although I do n't claim to understand relativity , I 've attempted to indwell the topic [ like sidphantha and his rock ] .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The point is my notion of time has changed ; And I think once humanity realizes that time - notions are human constructions and are subject to change , that then the impact of Einstien 's idea will be felt .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Schooling of the children 's\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I think children 's must be educated at school , not at home .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Because at school they can deal with other people , learning since young how to deal with the situations , with other thoughts and cultures , and learn with that stuff .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Knowledge it 's not just what we learn sit on a chair , but how to deal with society too .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Does n't make any sense the person be very smart , intelligent , intellectual , know everything about so many subjects , if he ca n't express yourself , your ideas .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If he can not act naturally facing difficulties or staying calm dealing with the others thoughts , different of his ideas , demonstrating how flexible he can be facing difficult situations .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The knowledge it 's a combination of the intellectual and emotion part of our brain .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It must be a balance with these two parts .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So , teaching the child alone at home , it 's not a good idea for his development .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The advantage of learning the child at home it 's see and follow exactly what he will learn , the time of study , seeing closely what the child is assimilating .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But , like I said before , it 's very important help them to deal with other people and situations since little 's , to combine the rational and emotional part of his brains .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It 's a hard decision for parents , more for those who wants control all the aspects of the lives of his children 's , but it 's necessary understand how important a decision like that is to the future of those kids .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It 's more important keep the control of everything or leave the child learn with his experiences and develop other skills .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I like and really loved football .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I do n't know why ? just love that . my favourite club is Real Madrid and my favourite player football is Kaka and CR 7 .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I do n't care every time I 'll watch my favourite club match .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Through football I can see him .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "He 's my favourite player , most favourite than Kaka .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If I can watch his competition I 'll watch it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "He 's my spirit also .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I loved a football since I was in 1st grade of junior high school . usually , I watched a football match with my father .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "At the mid night we 're watching together ...\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "My lovely team is my Country Garuda Team you 're the best in the world .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "This idea is completely erroneous .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Money perhaps , is a necessary evil in order to conduct the daily affairs of life .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Money , in some form or other , is required in order to carry out business trading , commerce and exchange of property .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Money enables a human being to store what he owns , to pay his expenses , to share with others or even to give to those in need .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This is a different concept all together .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The desire for what we may not have can at times cause people to conduct themselves in a way that they might not otherwise do .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Although there is a healthy desire to meet the needs that we have , at times this desire can be pushed to an extreme .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "How many times have we seen on the evening news a family being broken apart , a company going under , or even a nation crumbling simply because there was a desperate desire , on the part of one or many , for something that exceeds what was actually needed or required ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Even individuals can be destroyed who are in constant search of what evades them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They think that having the \" right \" car or living in the \" right \" neighborhood or knowing the \" right \" people can bring them happiness or contentment .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This love of money urges them on , causes them to neglect their families and at times to commit crimes for which they are imprisoned .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Our society pays dearly , both financially and socially , for their love affair with money .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is a cross - cultural thing .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "We can be speaking of the American dollar , the Japanese yen or the Spanish peseta .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The love of whatever represents the financial exchange between parties wreaks havoc in a nation , a family and even an individual life .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Not the money itself but rather the love of it persuades men 's hearts , capitivates their minds and influences their priorities and their behavior .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The hoarding of wealth for personal benefit or security when pushed to an extreme is the root of all evil .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It produces selfishness in even the smallest child .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It 's not long before a 4 - 5 year - old realizes the power that money brings .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "he begins to hide it , save it , ask for it and spend it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A healthy thing can be turned into a tool for disaster . is money the root of all evil ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "No .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It can be sued for good .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It can bring relief to those in need and even extra joy into a life that already has it 's needs met .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , the love it , the overwhelming desire for it that causes people to overlook what is most important and at times even commit terrible acts toward each other , is truly the root of all evil .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "History is the identity of people , It can tell the future generation about the past one .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As all nations and people have their own history and to distinguish this only by marks left .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Historical place as well as archive are the cmost common thing show the ancien life .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Every nation has its identity .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In my country there are a lot of historical places that refer to different civilization .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But the most place that attract more people is the capital , we can call it the carrefour of the civilization .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Different civilizations set up there from byzantine to french passing by ottoman and others .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Our attractive historical palce in CASBAH .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "CASBAH is historical city and has an important story about building it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I believe I am a good person for summer camp staff .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "I love to sit there and watch the sunrise .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Best wishes from my lovely new home .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I live in a tiny village named Fals , which there are n't lots of people , there are only , more or less , one hundred of people .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In my little village , the most people are farmers and they do n't use too many cars or motobikes , they just use trucks and other things .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So I think that in my village we take care of the environment , because we do n't waste a lot of pollution , so I can say that I live in a healthy village about the pollution .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But in my country we usually do n't take care of the environment , because people in Spain do n't think on other , they just think about their own .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Although the most of the spainish people do n't think about the environment because they say it 's not the present it 's the future .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The childhood , nowadays , is really involved with technology .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Most part of fun for children are video games , television , computers and tablets which they play electronic games and watch movies or cartoons .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On this way , is clear that television entertains and does part of our lives , but it can also educate if have appropriate subjects .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For example , some cartoons with their character can teach children count in other languages , resolve mathematics accounts as simple adds and the most important children can learn how to deal with their parents and their friends and learn what is wrong or right , in other words , television can influence on their behavior .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On the other hand , on television is common a lot of advertisementes witch can affect some choices and wills of the child as some kind of toy , soon he starts to ask this just because of the media .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Therefore , it is very important that parents have knowledge about what their children are watching and learning on tv .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Thus , television could be good for education , but the time in front of the screen have to be controlled , after all the childhood is also contructed playing or the open air !\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is apparently due to the huge improvement of the automobile industry which makes a better transport environment with dramatic transporting .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "You can easily travel from A place to B place while step into a private car which will create an electronic deliver lane and compress the data of the car with the driver .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Drivers just simply ignite the car engine , choose the destination with the accurate address , map the three dimension of street view and then drive .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In only five minutes , literally , you arrive .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "With the new way of driving , people do not have to walk through an 500 meter road to a public transportation like , train stations , or bus stations , while buy the modern cars which provide a better transport experience .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "In the Village the farmers always throw the tailing and the dead bodies of the animals in the canals which dirty the water which they use in watering the farmlands and this leads to the pollution of the food\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As a matter of fact , there is enormous quantity of ways of transmitting information , which always has been extremely important for people , especially nowadays .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "We can receive it as from old - fashioned , or traditional , source of information such as books , so from contemporary types of media , for instance , from TVs and radio .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Due to all kinds of sources have advantages and disadvantages , it will be considered some arguments to find the most effective .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Actually , broadcasting activities are great opportunities to get the latest news about a situation in the world or the latest knowledge about the different fields of science ; whereas , books can present obsolete or inadequate information .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Indeed , scientists have proved that about a half of information in books becomes outdated in 5 - 10 years .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In contrast , we can find that some data in the television and on the radio are deliberately distorted .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Nowadays , there is an opinion that the media is the fourth estate , which can influence our consciousness .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is too hard to disagree with it , when the information became a means of warfare , but not the method of enlightenment .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Then books come to the front as a means of history 's cognition : all human experience , which cumulated during all time of human existence , is represented there .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In conclusion , I guess that we should not choose the only way of communicating information , as all types of media has pros and cons .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Choosing the appropriate option for receiving the certain data is a skill we should learn .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "There are several reasons why people in the UK might cease to eat beef .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For example , everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , these occurances , are at best unlikely .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This disease is the human equivalent of ' MAD COW DISEASE ' or BSE .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In the 1960 's and 1970 's , cows were given feed which included sheep ( and their brains ) in its ingredients .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous , as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner , it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If people in the UK were to cease to eat beef , the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This is because with the beef market destroyed , the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened , cow farmers would cease to exist entirely .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The answer is pork , lamb and other meats .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportionate to the fall in demand for beef .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This would mean , that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Although cattle farmers could no longer remain in the beef market they could switch from cattle farming to pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The overall effect on the size of the agricultural industry would be virtually nil .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This is because the fall in the size of the beef market would correspond with a rise in the size of the other agricultural product markets .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This would mean that the structure of agricultural industry had altered greatly with the proportion of it taken up by the meats other than beef market growing .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "In many overcrowded cities , like New York and Tokyo , the first cause of air pollution is the chaotic and uncontrolled flow of vehicles which use fossil fuels to operate .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Nowadays a number of cars is increasing and number of public transport reducing .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There are many pros and cons of using cars .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "First of all , it is very usefull .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "You can drive anywhere and anytime .Secondly , it is more economic .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There is an opinion that in any job discipline should prevail over talent .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To my mind , I would not even question the statement .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Firstly , only regular constant selfdevelopment ( which needs great discipline ) makes a talent turn into a perfect skill in different professions .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Any talent is nothing without discipline .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is common knowledge that even the most gifted and talented musicians or ballet dancers , for example , never succeed without orderly hard work .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Even ballet dancers are famous for their strict discipline .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Secondly , even if a person does not have any evident innate abilities he or she can develop perfect skills ( provided discipline ) and become more impressive than a disorderly talent .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To add to this , the last World hockey championship showed how weak our Russian team ( stuffed with brilliant players ) was against less talented but more disciplined American team .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , not all people share my thoughts .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They say if you are a genuine talent discipline is unimportant because you already have talent and it is enough .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They also believe that talent is the only thing that matters in artistic professions and if you are not gifted , no discipline will help you .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I am afraid I can not agree with these people as I think discipline is more important than talent because only dowry is never enough , it needs support and day after day development .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As for creative professions , Pierre Cardin says that discipline and patience are on the first place for him .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I guess , we can trust him .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To sum it up , you see the problem is twofold and is a complicated one , but I still feel that discipline is the leading characteristic in any occupation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Well , my first impression is that : I 'm absolutely disagree with the statement , because in my mind the public transport is much more convenient than the car or almost the most tips of particular methods for travelling except walking or bicycle .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The reason is simple .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Travelling represents energy , then if you must spend energy , is more economic and environmentally friendly if you can translate many people with the same energy .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Also you can use better energy sources and with much better profit with the public transport than the personal car ( like electricity from solar or wind devices ) and then your level of greenhouse gases may be reduced in an important percentage .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "By other hand , you have a lack of comfort or worse or poorer availability for any displacement of you need , but the advantages of public transport over private transport , are more significants than disadvantages .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There were many objections raised against the introduction of the National Lottery when the idea was first proposed .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The main issued raised was the unemployment that would occur in the pools company industry .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As the Lottery would sound more appealing due to the larger winnings , greater public interest and the fact that it is easier to fill in than a pools coupon , less people would do the pools coupon , and this decrease in demand would mean that pools companies such as Littlewoods and Vernon would be forced to make employees redundent due to a decrease in profits .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There were also problems raised about addiction and people younger than sixteen obtaining numbers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "When the National Lottery was interduced and also the scratch cards many people became addicted to buying them , most of these people were unemployed or poorly paid and the Lottery represented a source of hope for future richness , for many this was not the case , and addiction meant large debts or resulting to violence and stealing to obtain extra money ; It was argued that this addiction is on a par with drug addiction and just as hard to kick .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It was also argued that many people under the age of sixteen would buy lottery cards encouraging the whole nation and its youth to become compulsive gamblers , when money could be better spent on other products for instant on extra food for the family , or saving for a holiday or a car .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There were also objections raised to the amount of money the proposed jackppot was to be each week and the idea of roll overs increasing this figure even more .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Many people argued that the general public would not be able to cope with becoming overnight multi - millionaires and the untold pressure of fame on the frount pages of a tabloid and begging letters would make many people crack , and that they would never lead a normal life ever again and lose many friends .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Finally the lottery was thought to put less money into charity collection boxes as everyone would prefer to put their last pound on a lottery card than in a collection box .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Despite this after a year of the National Lottery there are many cases put forward for retaining it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The main case is the amount of money of money that goes towards research charities , this was not the case at the start but was introduced later , also grants are given out to preserve our great countries heritage and culture , for example extensive work to repair an exsisting art gallery .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Also many sporting projects receive grants to build more recreational areas for the youth and public to express themselves and get them off the street and decipline them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Another case for retaining it is the fact that people are still prepared to buy a ticket , and if the demand for a ticket is there , there is no reason why the supply should not be also .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "This in turn would also have to lead to the formation of a central European bank .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A single Europe , whilst primarily being created as an economic union , will necessarily have implications on a political level .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The European Parliament of course already exists , but many people envisage that in a single Europe it will play a more important role and its power will be extended , possibly surpassing those exercised by individual national governments in Europe and overriding decisions made by them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For supporters of a single Europe the question of whether it will entail a loss of British sovereignty is not a primary issue .

{"src": "Critics of European union , on the other hand , are afraid that increased cooperation in both the economic and political spheres will give rise to a European superpower which will undermine the sovereignty of Britain in these fields .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Personally , I am in favour of a single Europe to the extent that I believe Britain can no longer afford to stand alone in opposition to the other countries in Europe , all of which have long been in favour of such a union .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The problems of these suggestions is that it would cost millions of pounds to put any one of them into practice .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "These people work hard throughout the year and can not afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The problem is , these working men and women and un - employed men and women do spend money they ca n't afford .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58 .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is gambling , but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Another point which is to analyse is the mode of presentation .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "As far as public transport is concerned there does not seem to be a way forward unless the can reduce the enormous amounts of petrol needed to fuel it .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Far from being only a benefit for the environment , this fact is also positive for the travellers who will be getting an important reduction in travelling costs with this new type of cars , which is provoking a direct decrease in the public transport 's use .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "If the time involved in the planning and enacting of a crime does not pay off in a gain that can justify that time expenditure , then the crime has not paid .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal could make in a legitimate field .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job , then crimes can earn less to justify time spent .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If a criminal is well educated and could function in one of the professions , then his crimes must earn more .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Lawyers can be very expensive , and if a criminal chooses to avoid the capital loss of a more expensive attorney , he could pay with the health loss of being imprisoned .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Even if someone is not imprisoned , long legal entanglements can be very stressful and unhealthy .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The washing machine , in those houses that own them , has almost become a necesity .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Should there be a fire in the house , many people might be seen furiously running about in the streets , clutching the machine tightly to their chests .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Give an average adult a washing board and soap and tell him / her to do a load of laundry , and watch the panicked look on his / her face .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "These \" wonders \" make it easier to spend less time doing manual labor .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But is that all that bad ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": ".... Many housewives would insist on its benefits , and I would have to agree .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that make our lives easier yet do n't allow us to exercise , to use our muscles .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is no small wonder that in today 's \" modern \" society , as we continously use our \" modern gadgets \" , we are increasingly needing diet programs and other such systems .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Yes , the old days were hard , but was weight watchers ever an issue ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Nowadays , more and more parents are starting to teach their children at home instead of sending them to school .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This may not be a bad idea at all , but it also has some disadvantages that I would like to discuss .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Firstly , we should take into account the fact that parents are n't usually specialized in all fields of study : even if they have a degree in History , they may not know how to help their children with a mathematics problem .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Besides , staying at home rather than going to school reduces the opportunities of meeting new people and making friends .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This is n't a good thing for the children because that way they are n't socializing , and when it comes the moment of having an interview to get a job , they wo n't really know how to behave .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On the other hand , having the chance to learn at home helps some students that , due to their complicated situation -like an illness- , can not go to school like the other children .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To sum up , I consider that children should study at school if they can afford it , because in the majority of cases , parents haven't the same knowledge as teachers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era , it is almost one of the most deadly .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "During a fight a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head , and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The brain is encased in the skull , but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid ' shock - absorber ' to protect the rain .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull , damaging it more and more every time .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So , a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years , ten for example , and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is still there .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects , yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose , eyes , teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma , haemorage or die .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Another aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers receive .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The question that people have is : is that person really worth several million pounds ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else , more important , where people are n't getting paid to fight .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport , there is an incredibly big demand for it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Boxing is one of the most popular sports , and it will be difficult to ban it .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "A study group is that a crowd of people gather in and discuss some topics they chose .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So , if you join a study group , you can understand what other 's idea are and how they think about this problem .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Also , you can exchange your own ideas to others so that there will be a discussion about it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Though this discussion , I think we can realize our thinking and other 's opinions more clearly .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Other benefit is that you can seize the opportunity to express yourself efficiently and methodically ; that is , your speaking skill will be improved .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , why do some people still study on their own ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In my opinions , I need to consider one question deeply by myself .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Sometimes , too many other thinking do disturb me !\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Maybe I will become a person who only listen to others ' ideas and never think by myself if I depend on study groups seriously .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To join study groups is a good way to inspire your learning motivation , but do n't forget , sometimes you have to leave yourself alone and consider what you have learned calmly .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "In the heart of Katowice there is an apartment with a specific aura of mystery .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The place hides a fascinating story of underground culture in Silesia .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For quite a long time ( especially in the 60s ) the studio was frequented by lots of bohemian artist where they could follow occult and Buddhist practices as well as paint some psychedelic pieces of art .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Some time ago I took the opportunity and experienced this magical aura for myself .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "It is said that boxing should be banned , described as a barbaric sport , it has been known to lead to deaths and brain damage of fighters .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The constant pounding of the head during a match does n't necessarily do take it 's toll immediately , but as a boxer 's career continues , the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Is it right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly battered about the head until they are no longer able to stand , could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence , children brought up to ' worship ' idols such as Frank Bruno , as he pummuls someone into a hazy blur .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Should boxing be banned .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "My answer to all of these questions is no .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Maybe boxing is brutal , but to fight is part of human nature and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people fighting in controlled circumstances .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "I think boxing should be encourage , in run down inner cities areas such as Moss Side , boxing is popular , it gives young lads a focus in life , it gives them a target .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Many of the best boxers came from such areas , in my opinion they are better of boxing than stealing cars , taking drugs and shooting each other .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Banning boxing is simply unnecessary , if it were banned then it would simply continue ' underground ' .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport as expert medical attention and proper match control would n't be ensured , the use of pads may also be ignored .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "I enjoy this sport and feel a sense of admiration for those who practise it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For them to be prepared for many obstacles and chasing around the time and finish line is amazing .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "You need to focus , have a lot of energy and mostly strength .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Not everyone is able to cope with that , which is something to be recognized .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Are you thinking of an influence regarding the way sports developed ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In my opinion , I think tradition remains even in the 21st century and sports differ from country to country .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On the whole , it does seem that watching sports entertain people from all over the world .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "When the bank notes are made , firstly , background colour , artwork , and security issues should be designed carefully .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The spicy news about politician and other celebrities like film stars are most wanted in our today 's life .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The truth is that politicians should take a resonsibility for their decision in government and take into consideration words they say .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It also covers film stars , because it 's one of those things that they are the last word to young nation .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "One of the most incredible 20th century discoveries , in my opinion , is the cellular telephone .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Many people buy them to take with them wherever they go so they can receive a call at any time .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They are a complete luxury and not a necessity .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The cellular telephone has changed people 's lives in many ways : the main way being the availability to be reached at any time .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Communication is readily available in cars and on the streets now .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "People are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency ; if they are stranded or broken down .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They can take their cellular phones on vacations and to their friends houses if they are expecting an important call .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To me , it is a bit ridiculous , but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Another way the cellular telephone has affected people 's lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving , they are more likely to get into an accident .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "There are many who feel that it can be a harmful thing , and this is true .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "I ca n't speak for others , but in my experience I would say it is a good idea to take a year off after high school .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "First of all because probably most of us do n't know what to do with our lives , or we just do what other people told us to do , especially our parents .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The lack of natural light in the workplace became a serious problem as more people complain about their bad relationships with others at work and the poor performance they have , therefore using inadequate lighting is the main reason for it .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "As a conclusion , there are many reasons which sustain the need for the employees of having access to the natural light while doing their jobs , because the lack of it can have negative effects , both on people and productivity , so it should be taken into consideration and there should be found a solution for solving the issue .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "There are several reasons why the image overlaps its creator .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "One is that usually one and the same actor is representing one and the same character in succession of films so that actor blends with his or hers character .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Healthy and young people\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Young people are less healthy now than twenty years ago according studies appears recently in newspapers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "One reason for this it 's that young people prefer to play video games to play outdoors because it 's more popular or for example because they are n't used to play football with their parents in the street .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Besides , young people eat too much junk food and they 're less willing to do sports which require more effort .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "However this , as seen in recent events for example Newbury , has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "another way to reduce congestion , especially in the large cities , could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Being famous means that probably most of your life journalists , your neighbours and ordinary people will be interested in your life .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "There is no doubt that celebrities work hard to achieve fame , better and desirable jobs , including supreme salaries .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The majority of celebrities have their personal managers , who take care about their image .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So even if you are rich and famous , it not always means that you would be able to live and act as you would like to .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "For example , many celebrities sell their baby born photos to magazines , as they offer enormous sums of money , in order to get a tiny glimpse into their family life .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "By setting a good example celebrities may become idols and inspire other people to live and help others , who are in need .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "She asked him why he did it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Micheal , instead of answering , shouted at her .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "He and his mother had a clash on something .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A while later , she left the room , leaving the door open .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "At that moment , Micheal began to calm down .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Genetic manipulation is an area which has caused a great deal of controversy within the scientic field with a number of advantages and disadvantages .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "One of the main advantages is the ability to tailor other organisms genetic makeup towards man 's needs .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The possibilities are endless , a crop could be designed that would grow in the dry , hot conditions of many third world countries , relieving them of their worries of starvation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Cattle could be bred which are more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass or even diseased could be killed off by altering people 's resistance to them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Of course to some extent genetic manipulation already exists .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of parents and gardeners cross breed plants to suit their individual needs .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , their is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The advantages seem very favourable and I 'm sure that a scientist would take much credit for these .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There are many possibilities for the misuse of this process .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "One is a question of ethics and morals .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Is it right to try and change motive ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Is it the right of one man to play God ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is also possible that we would not be able to control the new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A new plant which has an increased growthrate may seem like an answer to all our problems but what would we do if suddenly it upset the ecosystem , draining the soil of its nutrients and not allowing other plants to grow ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In theory a scientist should take responsibility for this but in an area such as genetic manipulation of which we do not know a great deal , it my not be possible to find a solution .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Another problem would be the process of testing .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "We are already near the stage where it is possible to test people 's genetic make up to find the possibility of their developing certain illness .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Soon it may be possible for firms to only employ people with a certain expected lifespan or for insurance companies to refuse to insure certain individuals on the basis of a genetic test .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Although the threat of the Cold War has diminished , the technology made available from studies into genetic warfare could be dangerous in the wrong hands - particularly in the area of germ warfare .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Although the scientists can take credit for the developments and improvements in the quality of life which their research brings , there are so many disadvantages that they would be forced to take responsibility for the misuse of this new technology .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "It was dusk , in the warm summer of the southern France , while they saw two men of security that walks towards them of the great zoo of this city , we look at each other and we said that the animal had been escaped from the zoo .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Finally , the starry sky and full night , and each one in your house .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "He was very exhausted and said:\"What an amazing day ! \"\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I 'm so glad to hear you are coming !\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "You have no idea how happy I am .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In connection with your question , I 'll try to tell you how you can reach my house .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There are three possibilities .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Firstly , you can take a taxi , but I have to warn you about the taxi drivers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They 're sly boots and they could ask you to pay more than it really cost .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Secondly , you can take the bus .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Unfortunately our buses are n't comfortable .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "And the last alternative , and I recommend this one to you , is my car !\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I 'll wait to collect you at the airport and it wo n't cost you anything .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Since you ask about the best places to visit , I 'd suggest visiting a few places such as Oxford , London and Piccadilly .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "These places are really pulchritudinous !\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I 'm sorry I wo n't be able to accompany you on your excursions , as I have not much free time and need to complete my assignments .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "You 're lucky because museums and galleries are not too far from my house .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "You can go to one of the most famous museums in the UK , such as the British Museum .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I recommend seeing the galleries in the Royal Academic of Arts and the National Portrait Gallery .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I 'm certain you will not be disappointed !\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I had never felt so nervous before in my life because it was the first time for me being on stage and singing in front of such a big crowd .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "How could I possibly know that some months after that day I would be performing for the president of our country for even more people ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As I walked towards the stage in this hall , feeling every eye piercing me , there were several things running through my head .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I thought of losing my consciousness , getting a heart attack or even worse : being shouted a bad singer by somebody from the audience .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "At this point my knees started wobbling and I felt as if I was going on pudding .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Whenever I make a flashback to these seconds , which felt like hours , I have no idea how I really managed to get on this stage but somehow I finally found myself standing there and in slow motion grabbing for the microphone with my hands shaking like an earthquake had just evoked .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The moment had come .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I inhaled and could almost feel the air widening my lungs .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I opened my mouth , tried to calm down and to bring all my concentration to the first note which ... did n't come .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Well , it did but not noticeable for anybody .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So I tried again and suddenly my attitude changed from the mouse who was nervous like hell to the woman who loved singing and sharing it with the world .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The melody started to flow and I was happily filling the hall with the music .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Like is it sayed in the top \" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "\" , yes I agree with that cuz ' now the people are geting tired to waith the bus or any public transport vehicles , now the personal car is the power , if you want to go ...\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "i do n't know ..... in a place like your holyday house , maybe a bus can not arrive there and you a need a personal car .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If you want to move stuff from a place to diferent place you ca n't do that with a bus , you need a personal car , so a personal care is better then a public tarnsport vehicle .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The principal aim of this report is to provide the organisers of an international festival with the information about the interests of young people in my country .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I am going to write about their interests in music , in the television programmes and in the clothes they are used to wearing , concluding with my personal statement .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Firstly , by conducting a survey among young people of my area , it emerged that music is essential for them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In fact , youngsters are inspired by the songs they listen to and by the music videos as well .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For the same token , most of those surveyed claimed that their favorite singer is also their idol .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Secondly , young people expressed their interest in television programmes such as films and series .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Series became so popular that numerous teenagers spend at least half of their afternoons watching series on their technology items , neglecting schoolwork and extracurricular activities .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Moreover , sometimes young people get obsessed by TV series and they lose their social life as well .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Lastly but not leastly , youngsters are interested in fashion .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In fact , almost every girl interviewed admitted that they are very keen on being fashionable , and a large number of them claimed that they love having a wide range of clothes in order to show how fancy they are .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In conclusion , I personally think that the next international festival should regard all of these young people 's interests if the orginisers want it to be a success .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In the picture I can see a boy walking two dogs on the seaside .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Dear Jo ,\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Firstly , I would like to thank you for visiting my country .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I am sure that my country is the best option .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The reason why I say this is it has plenty of wonderful landscape as well as career opportunity .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Next , I am proud to tell you about the beauty of my country .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There are 54 minorities living sociably together in the \" s \" shape country .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "My country has not only modern cities but also sparing villages that makes you feel a lot of emotion .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Especially , I would have to say that the cuisine is the thing which you should n't miss .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Then , despite being a developing country , there are many opportunity to grow your career .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Nowaday , Vietnam has been attracting foreign investments from many countries .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Besides that dominate industry also is improving prominently , specially , export field .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "A topic that I like so much is about electricity .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In today 's world everybody uses the electrical energy for almost all .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is present in your personal computer , lamps and anything which you need to plug it in .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But almost no one knows is that the electricity travels a long way to arrive in your houses .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The journey starts in the plant of energy , wherein the electricity is generate by resources like water , wind , solar energy , nuclear energy and other methods .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Then , the electrical energy travels even the substation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "After this , the electrical energy needs to lose a little bit of energy to arrive in your house without troubles and it occurs in a place called substation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Therefore , we need to thought very well before to waste energy .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Because it is an expensive cost for you and mainly for the environment .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "ESSAY\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is widely known that the majority of teenagers are keen on video games .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Some people believe that it 's waste of time and a bad habit too , while some others think that it 's a good way to spend your free time .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To my mind there pros and cons .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "First of all , computer games can help you to escape from your busy schedule and get some rest and relaxation after school .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Apart from that , quite convenient mainly because you stay at home and have entertainment .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Also video games are interesting than traditional toys so they capture teenager 's interest .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Last but not least , some of them are educational and give you the ideal opportunity to gain knowledge .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On the other hand , there are many drawbacks .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To begin when you spend a lot of hours in the computer screen you become addicted to them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As a result , you do n't get together with your friends and you do n't communicate face to face .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In addiction , a lot of video games are full of violence and teens are tend to imitate them so they have violent and aggressive behavior .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Also , playing video games for hours is very harmful to your eyes .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In conclusion , computer games is a nice way to spend your free time but always in moderation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I feel the invention of the computer has significantly changed people 's lives .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This , realistically , has been quite a new invention , and in its short life span has been able to change the world significantly .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Not to mention how it will change people 's life styles in the future .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "These changes resulting from the invention of the computer , have been , I feel both bad and good .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Technologically , computers have improved people 's lives drastically .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "No longer are the times when people must write a paper manually , or even with a simple typewriter .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Personal computers are becoming quite common , and therefore less expensive and easier to own .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Computers have also made live transpire much quicker than before .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "We now have ATM , automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would do .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It seems these days EVERYTHING is run by computers !\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "We are able to complete our tasks much better and much more efficiently .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Basically every facet of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "While computers have brought about improvements , in my opinion , they also have \" impersonalized \" the world .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not \" fast enough \" .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Interraction with humans in some places is extinct .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Yes , it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank , but I miss the human interraction between people .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In addition , it is also very dangerous to place all of one 's trust in a machine .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is a common fact machines do fail !\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Sure , a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on - coming obstical is approaching is safe , but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "People soon stop thinking , and allow machines to do the work for them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions , and therefore are incapable , in some instances to function .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "With the invention of the computer comes many changes from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle for the future .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Some of these changes will save people 's lives , such as advances in medical technology , safety , etc .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But I fear that our world will become a very impersonal place .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I hope that we will be able to determine what improvements should be made and what should just remain \" slow \" .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "It is a place located in the heart of Warsaw .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A lot of foreigners go there to try delicious , traditional South African grilled food .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is rather an informal restaurant , designed in a rustic style what guarantees a really nice ambiance .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "When it comes to food you can try all kinds of grilled meat , even the most exotic one .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "About the service , I can all it unusual as you choose your meat and the staff will prepare your dish , then you go to the kitchen to get your dish and eat it with your hands .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I have been there once and I really like that place , you feel at home and the food is delicious .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The price is also the cheapest I could find in this country .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "the best film\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "When you see the thriller you can stop looking for and immediately you want to see the film .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It 's a move that all people could see .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "i think i find it exciting because i love all film like them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "this great move is about a group of people that go to the secondary school , this school its not like all school , its different because you a lot of activity 's like basketball , theater , etc .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "i think that people could like to see it because when you saw , you can stop it and you have a lot of music , song and people dancing .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "in my opinion it s the best film i saw in my life and if you have the oportunited to see , do it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox 's getting at his chickens .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport , as it will not be fun to experience .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel , it is just the way of life .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The fox is then chased until it is caught .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A few people enjoy the sport and allows them to socalise .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I myself believe that fox hunting should be banned as it is very cruel .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Anouther reason why it should not be banned is because foxes give chickens a cruel death when they kill them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If they decide they have to continue the sport because they need to kill the foxes , the sport should be banned and a more reasonable death should be considered .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "REPORT\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This report will deal with whether cars should be banned from the centres of all major cities or not .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Too many cars running around the people can be a serious problem to deal with .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But what should we do to make it up ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There are some pros and cons .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Pros\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "First , there would be less noise in streets .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In particular in Spain where city centres are usually quite narrow .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Second , there would be less air pollution .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is proved that too much smog in the atmosphere is harmful to the health .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Third , cities would be friendlier to live .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Places where people could enjoy walking around .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Cons\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "First , local sellers ' work could be damaged in that area because they could need to upload and download goods for the shops .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Second , people who lives in that part of the city could be affected in a negative way because they could need to pass through it with some cars so as to get home .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In my opinion it would be a good idea to do it but we would need to balance different interests in order to do it right .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There is an opinion that computers will be used instead of books in the future .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I believe that it is true , because computers are more convenient and easier to use .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Tablets are light and you can give only it without caring many heavy books .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The Single European Act , signed in February 1986 by the Heads of Government of the 12 Member States of the European Community and which came into force on 1st July , 1987 aims to create a single market by the end of the year 1992 .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal , technical and physical barriers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell his goods in any community country , an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state and also work in any member state with national qualifications .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Despite the fact that the proposals put forwad to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman , namely Lord Cofield , there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market , shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers , whereas Jacques Delors , the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In accordance with the Constitutional Law of Britain , Parliament is the supreme law - making body in the United Kingdom .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Personally , I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom of transportation , movement , work and many other realms , there are also many disadvantages in store , including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Although the British Parliament will continue to regulate the acts or omissions of individuals on a personal basis , for example in Criminal Law , its freedom to legislate in the domain of public law will be severely restricted .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "To solve the problem of traditional model .

{"src": "I think the whole world would benefit : Environment , people , family , work .. so on\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I agree with this statement . I think future will be like everyone will have their own car and they wo n't use public transport .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Nowadays , every person want to live convenient for yourself .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So they just buy new car for yourself 's using .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But some people ca n't buy it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Because , they haven't got enough money and they have material problem .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So they accounts to use public transport .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There is untouchable to poor people .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In my opinion , using public transport will be not so popular than travelling bycar .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In my opinion the public transport has a long future because a lot of people live in big city and they do n't use the car for move in the city because the public transport is more comfortable , which they can take the bus and next take the underground and finally arrive in anyplace that they want .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But if they use the car probably the world be late for the place that they go .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I think if the people use a public transport there are less contamination and the sky on the city should be blue instead of grey so anybody should't say that the public transport is n't have future .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Lots of people believe that sooner or later public transport will lose their important role .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "First of all due to fact that travelling by car is much more convenient .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Actually you can use your vehicle not only to get to the office or to reach the shopping mall , but even to go on holiday without having to stand in a queue before catching a train , a plane or a bus .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Actually , there are lots of traffic jams , and it is quite common being stacked along the road .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But it could be quite the same for travelling by bus and other means of transport .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Secondly cars are becoming cheaper day after day , so everyone can afford to buy one , even those who are not considered wealthy people .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So far public transport has been considered relatively cheap , environmentally correct and fast .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On the one hand , we can not forget that cars have a bad impact on the quality of air and that they are one of the most important causes of pollution .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On the other hand , everyone is more or less aware that airlines companies have surely a great impact on the air pollution .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Anyway , it could be possible travelling by car and when you arrive in a certain destination , you can choose to cycle or to walk instead of catching buses , trains , the underground or other public means of transport .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Cycling or walking could be even better than public transport : much more healthy , cheaper and faster .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "We must even take into consideration the fact that the car industry has developed lots of new vehicles .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There are now available new models , for example electric cars , that are environmentally - friendly ; they are not so expansive so everyone can buy one of them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In conclusion , I strongly believe that there is no future for public transport and that travelling by car will be day by day faster , cheaper and even environmentally less dangerous .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I think doing sports are healthy .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "My teaching philosophy changed considerably when I finished this course that based on theories in second language acquisition .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Until now , my beliefs in teaching English focuses on the following opinions : ( i ) children should be familiarity with English as early as possible ( ii ) the teacher should give students motivation so that they can gain their target goal in learning language ( iii ) teacher must be a good monitor in class ( iv ) the teacher must be well interaction with students .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "My beliefs help me feel more confident to become an English teacher in the future .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "First of all , parents should let their children learn English early .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "My first misunderstanding is that adults will acquire second language better than children .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "By reading child language acquisition of SLA , I know that the period that people can acquire the second language best is in childhood ( McLaugh , 1978a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.123 ) .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Moreover , children at the age between 5 and 9 that called critical period , they can acquire second language naturally that do not need any special methods of teaching .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Children have better phonology than adults and they display morphological sensitivity that adults can not .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , older learners will be successful in second language ( L2 ) syntax .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Patkomski ( 1980 ) found that learners who learned L2 after the age of puberty received lower proficiency scores than learners who started learning L2 before puberty .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Therefore , in the future , I will encourage everyone to let their child make an acquaintance with English as early as possible to help their children have accent like native speakers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If I have a chance to teach children , I will create an active atmosphere with various activities which focus on communications skills and give students opportunities to expose with authentic input such as cartoons , music , etc .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Secondly , the teacher should inspire to students motivation and raise student 's awareness in learning so that they can gain their target goal in learning language when I was in grade ten , I did not have willingness motivation to learn English because of my parents ' obligation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Consequently , my results do not meet the goal as my parents expected .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Until I met a tutor invited by my parents , I passed the exam in class with high mark , and I have motivation to learn better .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I want to become an English teacher .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Motivation is the second most important factor in SLA that makes students achieve in learning L2 ( Skehan,1989 , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.426 ) .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Students can use their whole time to do what they are interested in , and they will never get bored .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The more motivated one has been in language learning , students will gain the more successful .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is really a long - term project that students can improving their proficiency in second language .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They need to observe number of comprehensible input , and do many tasks to obtain their goal .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As a teacher , I will make efforts to increase the students frequency motivation because of its the changes overtime D\u00f6rnyei and Ott\u00f3 ( 1998 ; and detailed in D\u00f6rnyei , 2000 , 2001a , as cited in Gass and Selinker , 2008 , p.428 ) .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Thirdly , the good teacher is the one that can well - organized all of activities in class .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For instance when I teach grammar , I have to define how many structure that I can teach in a lesson is enough , and with some difficult grammar rules , I need to break it to teach in turn .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Learners need time to memory the new rule and acquired in their learned system .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "After teaching the rule , I will ask my students to work in pairs and communicate using the new structure base on my cue cards .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "When they are working , I can hear their conversation and know not only what they say but also how they say , so I can know whether they are acquired the rules or they just use their learned knowledge .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "One such demonstration of this has been the forming of the European Community , made up from the European Coal and Steel Community , the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Economic Community .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In 1987 , the European Community adopted the single European Act in which the member countries committed themselves to the realisation of a single internal european market by 1992 .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "This economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain , as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "British sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "If the European Community was to bring in a single currency , Britain may be deprived of its sovereignty since it will lose its individuality , but more importantly would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "If a single Europe should lead to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe instead of its own nation , most sovereignty would be lost .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It would mean a supranational force fighting as a whole , with no real difference between them - it would not be a case of \" one force , one nation \" .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , the state would still exist as an island and people will always feel that they were british due to their roots and history .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "One area which has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Since the early 1980 's , when computers such as the Spectrum 48 K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people , controversy has followed about their effect on children .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child 's ability to learn .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers , such as the Amiga and PC , has served to deepen the \" problem \" .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children ; a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast mayority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer , the calculator , to help them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Another moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace man in the workplace .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The role of computers is already significant in employment areas , such as accountancy , which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "These computers have replaced humans and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As the computers are : more efficient than humans , do not require payment for their work , are less temperamental than humans and will never have a day off because it is ill , it seems mankind is faced with a great problem .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Another claim made that suggest the human brain could become useless is that computers promote anti - social behaviour .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world and it also contains many other functions to , supposedly , make life easier for us .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Time management is a crucial factor for productive learning .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Firstly , as described by the Academic Skills Unit ( 2012 ) , time management can be achieved by making a \" daily planner \" ( p.23 ) .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "So I downloaded a daily planner and filled it with my study plans .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Doing this helps to complete my daily tasks more efficiently .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Secondly , the research of Mark ( 2006,p.25 ) also states that scattered time in a day should be utilised and made more productive .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For instance , I looked for chances to talk to native speakers while waiting for the train , or participated in conversation actively during my breaks .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Krashen 's theory is one of the most known and influent acquisition theories from the seventies .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The Acquisition - Learning is perhaps the most fundamental of all the hypotheses to be presented here .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It states that adults have two distinct and independent ways of developing competence in a second language .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On one hand , we have the acquisition that according to Krashen is the unconscious process children have since they are born to develop their ability in their first language .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Language acquires are not usually aware of the fact that they are acquiring that language .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They are not aware about the rules , they speak without thinking that what they are saying is correct , and they do not stop to think about the errors they commit because they do not think they are doing it wrongly .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "On the other hand , we have the learning process ; it implies the developing of the competence in the second language .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "We use the term learning ; to refer to the conscious knowledge we have of the second language , being aware about the rules for example .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Some theorists say that children acquire , but that adults can not do it , they just learn .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But according to Krashen , the acquisition - learning process says that adults , can also acquire , the ability of picking - up languages , does not disappear when we grow up .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But at the same time , it does not mean that adults can always achieve the native language levels , or that they can have access to the same natural \" language acquisition device \" that children use , it is so different .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Acquisition is a powerful process in adults .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Acquisition can not be converted in learning and in the other way round .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "They are two different process acquisition is the most important one , because we have to control first , the mother language , and after that the learning of more languages .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "An application for teaching , according to this theory could be that the optimal way a language is learned , is through natural communication .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Unfortunately the disease carrying organs were not just fed back to chickens but to cows as well .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The cows contracted the disease ( in a slightly different form ) and this was when \" BSE \" first came about .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The consequences are few , especially when one considers the shockingly low percentage of criminals who actually end up in jail .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "The proof exists on any street in urban America : underprivileged youth rolling in luxury automobiles and rolling wads of money into their designer jeans .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This is less of a choice than it is an act of taking advantage of an opportunity .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Nowadays , the aeroplane is treated as an ordinary aspect of our life .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Its chief purpose is to transfer people safely from one place to another .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , a few decades ago we had a very limited notion of such a technology .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Yet , in the present , so ubiquitous it is that we seem not to take notice of air business .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If one were to delve into the most paramount inventions of the last century , they would probably indicate modern conveniences , namely television or the computer .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "We tend to underrate the importance of the Aeroplane .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is clearly obvious that air travel has had an enormous impact on the way we conceive the world .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Firstly , as a result of its development we can experience a noticeable soar in mass tourism .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "People have ample opportunities to set off on a riveting journey to places they previously imagined while reading an adventurous book .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Besides , the great influence of the Aeroplane may be seen in mass emigration .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Had it not been for Wright brothers emigrants and casualties would not be able to settle in remote lands , hence the world would teeter financially .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "As far as vast changes which the aeroplane has undergone are concerned , society 's attitude has also improved .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In the first place , throughout decades we had distant relation with such initially fallible a workhorse .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "A classic illustration of this could be the use of air machines only for martial purposes .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Since the 20th century was about wars , we would only kill and exterminate people .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Additionally , creating such a vehicle was our morbid fascination since the time immemorial .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Nonetheless , the situation has somewhat normalised .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Air travel has converted from luxury at the rich 's disposal to a common thing available for almost everyone .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I personally believe that the influence , which the aeroplane has had on our life is significant , yet we have to bear in mind dangers connected with it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "For instance , at the beginning of 21st century tourists have been under the constant threat of terrorists .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Moreover , the opportunities which air technology brings may easily contribute to further development .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Perhaps , it will improve to such an extent that commuting from Tokyo to London would be in the twinkling of an eye .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To sum up , air business and its changes have been important for the world .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Apart from minute drawbacks , we can only laud its benefits .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It has certainly had and edifying effect on our thinking of travelling .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Many years ago , people lived without all things we have nowadays , it is , mobile phones , LED TV 's , computers , etc .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "This means that we have experimented an important change with the passing of time , it is due to the rise of technology , and it entails that people 's life change .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Now , will we continue developing our technology and our life ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "From my point of view , technology will continue changing our life in aspects of routine , free time , up to the point that we will not be able to live without using them .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is a problem , we must not depend on items like phones , TV , and all items created by technology .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "If we had to live in the past , bearing in mind all our dependency about technology , we would not able to life in this way , I am sure of it .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Nonetheless , I think that people 's life will improve thanks to the technology , not only is referring to bad things like the dependency of technology , it offers us interesting things like new technologies , new informatics systems in order to improve the world of job , the improvement in a wide range of job sectors , agriculture , healthy system , etc .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Finally , in order to sum up , I think that people 's life will change , but not dramatically , it depends on each person and the way in which people focus their lives .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Unfortunately I haven't seen any trillers for ages .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I prefer other genres .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I saw a really great comedy by Wes Anderson last month .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It 's title is The Hotel Grand Budapest .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The story took place in Eastern Europe between the two world wars .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The hotel manager used to take care about his regular clients , especially old ladies .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "The hotel florished and the manager felt himself and behaved like a God in his small universe .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "He hired the teenaged Indian refugee as a bellboy and taught him all his skills .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "He gave the boy a lot of lessons of hospitality , friendship , corrage and humanity .\n", "trg": "-"}

{"src": "Nowadays , public transport is less convenient than travelling by car because there are other solutions like the platform of internet that is about sharing the car for a relative low price with people that is going to go to the same destination .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Sharing the car could be an alternative to save money but also it is more comfortable than travel with a lot of people .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "First of all , public transport have less combinations ; it is too difficult to travel for example , if you had to work at nocturne hours and in special days it is impossible to catch a seat .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "On the other hand , if you have lost the bus , train or any other public transport , you had to wait a long time between them and it results maddering .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "In conclusion , people prefer travelling by car because it is more comfortable , you can go everywhere you want at the hour you consider the best and choose to share the space with other people or not .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Nowadays people spend lots of money in order to go to an English speaking country to improve their language skills .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "But is it really the most effective way of learning a language ?\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "From my point of view , studying in a foreign country has certain drawbacks .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Firstly , this way is very expensive as the tuition fee for overseas students is rather high .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Besides , when you study abroad , you have to adapt to a very different way of life , which can be quite stressful .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "What is more , English teachers do not speak Russian so if you do n't know English well , you will not understand their explanation .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is often assumed that it is better to study a language abroad because you can always use it speaking with native speakers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "However , I doubt that we will have lots of opportunities to speak abroad as we do not know many people there .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "It is also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified as those in England .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I totally disagree with this opinion because Russian teachers can compare two languages and explain grammar rules better .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "To sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country because you can always get the necessary help from your teachers .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "Moreover , today we have lots of opportunities to improve our skills such as communicating with English pen friends over the Internet .\n", "trg": "-"}
{"src": "I think that we should travel abroad so as to practise a language but not to study it .\n", "trg": "-"}
